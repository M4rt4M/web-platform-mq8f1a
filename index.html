    <h1>Noughts and Crosses</h1>
    <h2>Your mission</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">noughts and crosses</a> board which should already let you click on squares in order to make a move - try it out.
    </p>

    <p>Unfortunately it doesn't currently detect who has won, <strong>we want you to implement the code to fix that.</strong></p>

    <h3>Extension Points</h3>
    <p>It doesn't matter if you don't get here, these are just some extra tasks to consider if you have some spare time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detect a draw</li>
      <li>Provide a way to reset the game to its start state</li>
      <li>Stop players from making extra moves when the game is over</li>
      <li>Make the game work for a bigger board, say 4x4</li>
    </ul>
